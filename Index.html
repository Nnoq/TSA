            In contrast to the flu, a common cold can be caused by many different types of viruses. The condition is usually harmless and symptoms usually resolve within two weeks.
            Symptoms include a runny nose, sneezing, and congestion. High fever or severe symptoms are reasons to see a doctor, especially in children.
            Most people recover on their own within two weeks. Over-the-counter products and home remedies can help control symptoms.</td>
